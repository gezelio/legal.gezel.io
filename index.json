It\u0026rsquo;s quite simple; to be an advocate of Mystl.ink and further Gezel things. With being a free product, this limits the amount we can advertise, and hope that the spread of word-of-mouth and promotion by our advocates helps spread the great word of Mystl.ink.\nThis document is mainly for Mystl.ink, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you can\u0026rsquo;t advocate for other Gezel tools such as GezelBot and others.\nDo I get perks? Yeppers! We offer all Brand Ambassadors the following:\nPromotion on the website A \u0026ldquo;verified\u0026rdquo; badge Access to our cloud servers where they can get free storage for personal use (should you want it) Early access to tools (staging servers, early insights to make videos, reviews, etc) Insight and opinions on where we\u0026rsquo;re headed We hope to eventually make a Twitch \u0026ldquo;Team\u0026rdquo; at some point too, but until someone is Partnered that\u0026rsquo;s unlikely to happen.\nWhat can I disclose? You can disclose whatever you want! We\u0026rsquo;d recommend pointing any questions your community have to our roadmap (currently only on the staging site, will be updated soon on the main site). If you know we\u0026rsquo;re working on a feature someone asks about, feel free to let them know that you know it\u0026rsquo;s coming down the line!\nIs there anything mandatory? We just hope that you fill out your Twitch/YouTube/whatever with the relevant links. For example, don\u0026rsquo;t promote a * insert other link page here * link when you\u0026rsquo;re supposed to be a BA, it obviously doesn\u0026rsquo;t look good for us! ðŸ˜… Fill out any Twitch panels, assets, etc to let people know you think we\u0026rsquo;re awesome, and you think they should join us, too!\nHow do I become a BA? This is still a WIP. Right now, becoming a BA is \u0026ldquo;invite only\u0026rdquo; pretty much, as we\u0026rsquo;re reaching out to people directly to who we think they\u0026rsquo;ll be a good fit. We plan on opening up an invite system soon to apply.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re eager, the best way to become a BA is to be an advocate. We recognize all the people who represent and work with us, and if you\u0026rsquo;re super eager, we\u0026rsquo;ll notice you!\nSee our Brand Assets Join our Discord ","date":"March 12, 2023","permalink":"/posts/brand-ambassadors/ba/","section":"Mystl.ink Docs","summary":"What do we expect from Brand Ambassadors?","title":"Brand Ambassadors"},{"content":"","date":"March 12, 2023","permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"Need help?

If you can\u0026rsquo;t find what you\u0026rsquo;re looking for, feel free to use our search feature!\nHow often can I change my username? You can change your username as frequently as you\u0026rsquo;d like. We have no restrictions on this, so do know that it may be possible for someone to \u0026ldquo;snipe\u0026rdquo; your previous username once you change it!\nYou may also notice that some usernames are not available, also. We do have a denylist of usernames that aren\u0026rsquo;t available should we see if they\u0026rsquo;ll conflict with our systems, or too similar to another user.\nWe plan on improving this in the future and set a \u0026ldquo;30 day lock\u0026rdquo; on all previous usernames, though this is currently not in affect.\nHow do I become \u0026ldquo;Verified\u0026rdquo;? Is there a process? As of right now, no. Only users we personally vouch for and bring onboard for things like being a Brand Ambassador or completed work with us get verified status.\nWe plan on expanding this in the future, but there hasn\u0026rsquo;t been much thought put into it yet. If you have ideas, please, share them on our Discord.\nWill Mystl.ink ever have a paid tier? This is a hard one to answer, to be honest. So right now, Mystl.ink is a free service, with 0 features locked behind paywalls. The only way to give us money is to support us on Ko-Fi (which we really appreciate!!).\nWith that being said, if we blow up and have 100k users tomorrow, our servers will keel over and die before we get a chance to do anything.\nThe founders have put thought into this, and we think potentially should we ever need to do something to raise funds is that we\u0026rsquo;ll add super exclusive features for certain people such as remove branding, fully custom URLs, and even services like web hosting. Right now, this really isn\u0026rsquo;t important as we\u0026rsquo;re happy to foot the bill for the people.\nThe most important thing to remember is that we like to think of ourselves as a \u0026ldquo;For the people\u0026rdquo; company. We didn\u0026rsquo;t build these tools to make money, we build these tools to help the community.\nHow do I become a Brand Ambassador (BA)?
