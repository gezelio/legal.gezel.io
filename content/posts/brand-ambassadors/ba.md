## What do we expect from Brand Ambassadors?
It's quite simple; to be an advocate of Mystl.ink and further Gezel things. With being a free product, this limits the amount we can advertise, and hope that the spread of word-of-mouth and promotion by our advocates helps spread the great word of Mystl.ink.

***This document is mainly for Mystl.ink, but that doesn't mean you can't advocate for other Gezel tools such as [GezelBot](https://bot.gezel.io/) and others.***

### Do I get perks?
Yeppers! We offer all Brand Ambassadors the following:
- Promotion on the website
- A "verified" badge
- Access to our cloud servers where they can get free storage for personal use (should you want it)
- Early access to tools (staging servers, early insights to make videos, reviews, etc)
- Insight and opinions on where we're headed

We hope to eventually make a Twitch "Team" at some point too, but until someone is Partnered that's unlikely to happen.

### What can I disclose?
You can disclose whatever you want! We'd recommend pointing any questions your community have to our [roadmap](https://staging.mystl.ink/roadmap) (currently only on the staging site, will be updated soon on the main site). If you know we're working on a feature someone asks about, feel free to let them know that you know it's coming down the line!

### Is there anything mandatory?
We just hope that you fill out your Twitch/YouTube/whatever with the relevant links. For example, don't promote a * __insert other link page here__ * link when you're supposed to be a BA, it obviously doesn't look good for us! ðŸ˜… Fill out any Twitch panels, assets, etc to let people know you think we're awesome, and you think they should join us, too!

## How do I become a BA?
This is still a WIP. Right now, becoming a BA is "invite only" pretty much, as we're reaching out to people directly to who we think they'll be a good fit. We plan on opening up an invite system soon to apply.

If you're eager, the best way to become a BA is to be an advocate. We recognize all the people who represent and work with us, and if you're super eager, we'll notice you!
