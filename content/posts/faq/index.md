### How often can I change my username?
You can change your username as frequently as you'd like. We have no restrictions on this, so do know that it may be possible for someone to "snipe" your previous username once you change it!\
You may also notice that some usernames are not available, also. We do have a `denylist` of usernames that aren't available should we see if they'll conflict with our systems, or too similar to another user.\
We plan on improving this in the future and set a "30 day lock" on all previous usernames, though this is currently not in affect.

### How do I become "Verified"? Is there a process?
As of right now, no. Only users we personally vouch for and bring onboard for things like being a Brand Ambassador or completed work with us get verified status.\
We plan on expanding this in the future, but there hasn't been much thought put into it yet. If you have ideas, please, share them on our [Discord](https://gezel.io/discord).

### Will Mystl.ink ever have a paid tier?
This is a hard one to answer, to be honest. So right now, Mystl.ink is a free service, with 0 features locked behind paywalls. The only way to give us money is to support us on [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/gezel) (which we really appreciate!!).\
With that being said, if we blow up and have 100k users tomorrow, our servers will keel over and die before we get a chance to do anything.\
The founders have put thought into this, and we think potentially should we ever need to do something to raise funds is that we'll add super exclusive features for certain people such as remove branding, fully custom URLs, and even services like web hosting. Right now, this really isn't important as we're happy to foot the bill for the people.

The most important thing to remember is that we like to think of ourselves as a "For the people" company. We didn't build these tools to make money, we build these tools to help the community.
